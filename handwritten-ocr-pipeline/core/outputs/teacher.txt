Osmosis is the next movement of silent molecular usually water )
through a semi permeable membrane firm a region of higher water
patential Ghibke solution ) to a region of lower water potential
concentrated solution ) .
It is a positive transport process , meaning it requires no energy
The process continues until the water potential an both sides of the
membrane is equal , reaching a state of dynamic equilibrium .
In biological systems , this is crucial for maintaining cell tangiality
and nutrient transport .
